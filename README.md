## Introduction
This repository contains my solution to the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-009) course project.  The project revolves around a [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) obtained by measuring sensor output from accelerometers on a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  The goal of the project is to demonstrate proficiency in obtaining and cleaning data by cleaning and reshaping the provided dataset to compute desired metrics.
